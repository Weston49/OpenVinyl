### What you planned to do

* Created group email, Spotify developer account, and got the projet API credentials: [Issue #3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/OpenVinyl/issues/3)
* Added a Spotify sidebar integration: [Issue #13](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/OpenVinyl/issues/13)
* Created getter functions for all non-user related data: [Issue #2](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/OpenVinyl/issues/2)

### What you did not do

* I wanted to add direct playback integration through Spotify API on the sidebar
* Need to adjust sizing on the sidebar to make it smaller so that it's more 1080p friendly

### What problems you encountered

* I wanted to implement sidebar playback throught he Spotify API, which would be simple, but I found the Spotify APK which allows for seamless integration (although it's tough to implement)
* My sidebar ended up way too big in the final implementation. Need to preview on multiple screen sizes
