### What you did not do
(Give a short bulleted list of the items that you planned to do, but did not accomplish)
* I wanted to add direct playback integration through Spotify API on the sidebar
* Need to adjust sizing on the sidebar to make it smaller so that it's more 1080p friendly

### What problems you encountered
(List the problems you encountered)
