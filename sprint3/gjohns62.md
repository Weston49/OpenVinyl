### What you accomplished

During this sprint, I was mainly focused on fixing bugs and adjusting styling through out OpenVinyl. I worked on the account settings page, improving the button styling to make it more aesthetically pleasing. I also worked on removing the file selector used to update the user's profile photo, and integrate it into the preview photo on the page. Separately, I worked on the sign up and sign in pages, making them mobile responsive, improving the styling, fixing bugs with how certain elements were displayed. I also worked on the mobile nav view, adding the new "Games", "Account Settings", and "Connect with spotify" links to that view.
