# Description

Here is my hello world site that uses sveletekit and css animations to animate hello world in your browser.

# Running

1. cd into the svelte-app directory
2. npm install
3. npm run dev -- --open

# How this will be used in the project

Sveltekit will be the web framework for this project. We will also be using our own custom css elements utilizing the componentization that svelte uses to keep everything organized and consistent across the site.
