# Description

This is a basic Svelte program that puts a random cover art from the band "julie" on the screen. The art can be randomly changed with the button at the center of the page.

# To Run

 - clone the repository
 - cd into the ```album-covers``` directory
 - with npm installed, run ```npm install```
 - run ```npm run dev``` and open the localhost link

# Use

We plan to use Svelte as the web framework for our project. This program uses the cover art urls given by the Spoitfy API, so we know those will be easy to display in the actual project.
