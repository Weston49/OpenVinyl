# Assignment 6: Hello Plus

### Overview

This is a simple react web app built with Vite. The purpose of the app is to pull the text "Hello World+" from a database in Supabase. This technology would work really well with our project as we will need to pull information from our database when a user loads the site.

### Required Dependencies

To run this on your computer, you must have npm and node.js installed on your device. You can get that <u>[HERE](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)</u>.

### Instructions

To launch the app on your computer, you should git clone this repo.

Then CD into the "my-app" folder that is in this directory and run the following command.

```npm install```

That will install ```node_modules``` folder into the ```my-app``` folder. Once installed, you can run the following command to launch the app.

```npm run dev```

This will launch a localhost that should pull the text "Hello World+" from the test Supabase database that I have set up.
