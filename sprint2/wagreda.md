### What you accomplished

I worked a lot this sprint on polishing and cleaning up some features made by my othe team members and things we did in sprint 1. Some of this included fixing scrolling bugs on a few pages, making icons clickable that look like they should be clickable, and reworked parts of the review creation menu. I also made several small changes to styles in some places and created a readme for the project.
