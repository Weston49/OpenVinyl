### What you accomplished
I spent most of my time this sprint working on the "Charts" page, which didn't exist at the start of this sprint. I created a component to display the top 50 songs globally, and added a podium to display the users whose posts have the most likes. Both of which are features that I'd like the expand upon and polish over the next sprint. Other than that, I got in a few tweaks in other miscellanous area of the site (adding post description + changing playback icons).
